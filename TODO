TODO ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Add context menu to set local storage path

Debug python context menu
   - copies .command.sh into .command.py and launches debug

Add run timer to running pipeline context description

Make icons look better (refresh has white border, NF Sandbox main icon is off-center); ensure light/dark both look correct

Document

Package/Post

Keep last run/pipeline folder expanded config between activates (store in state)

Duplicate - pipelines context

Copy Name - runs context (may not be supported)

Max archives in settings - default to something reasonable (unset allows unlimited)

COMPLETED ----------------------------------------------------------------

Distinguish killed from failed by checking for exit code 143 (killed by NF) or 137 (killed by OS)

Make more efficient by only decorating open folders in the run view

*** NEED A Separate output window for each pipeline ***

Only select storage path when creating a pipeline (don't add script at this step)
   - currently it's required, will have to make optional, add support for removing/setting

Add config support (running with config instead of run)

Re-order configs (order matters) - added MoveUp/MoveDown context menu

Make storage path a setting, so that it doesn't have to be set everytime

Setting for Automatically Show Log on Nextflow exit

Debug docker context menu
   - lanches docker container with work folder mapped (see .command.run docker run command) and attaches visual studio if possible

Added settings.json for args/options

Fixed: when running to quickly after modifying settings, args/options may be undefined - need to synchronize
