TODO ---------------------------------------------------------------------

sort process work folders by time (maybe sort all)

MAYBE group config files under a psuedo-folder

MAYBE "ASSETS" view (displays ~/.nextflow/assets/) 

MAYBE support drag/drop for adding files (if possible w/ vscode API)

MAYBE user may set work folder in args (could inform runs view of work folder when starting, instead of runs view assuming run_N...)

USER Must include nextflow.config if other config is included on repo runs

MAYBE Check valid args for command-type (e.g., "-resume" doesn't apply to config)

WON'T DO If repo specified, add sym-links in Pipeline view to assets folder contents

Remove auto port setting when launching container; instead, get options from tasks.json (?)

Add Launch Container and Attach Visual Studio Code; adds work folder to workspace; opens terminal at work folder

Add Gear button to open settings (Pipelines - one per pipeline)

Update log instead of appending (like docker build)

Add context menu to set local storage path

Debug python context menu
   - copies .command.sh into .command.py and launches debug

Add run timer to running pipeline context description

Make icons look better (refresh has white border, NF Sandbox main icon is off-center); ensure light/dark both look correct; check out: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-codicons

Document

Package/Post

Keep last run/pipeline folder expanded config between activates (store in state)

Duplicate - pipelines context

Copy Name - runs context (may not be supported)

COMPLETED ----------------------------------------------------------------

Distinguish killed from failed by checking for exit code 143 (killed by NF) or 137 (killed by OS)

Make more efficient by only decorating open folders in the run view

*** NEED A Separate output window for each pipeline ***

Only select storage path when creating a pipeline (don't add script at this step)
   - currently it's required, will have to make optional, add support for removing/setting

Add config support (running with config instead of run)

Re-order configs (order matters) - added MoveUp/MoveDown context menu

Make storage path a setting, so that it doesn't have to be set everytime

Setting for Automatically Show Log on Nextflow exit

Debug docker context menu
   - lanches docker container with work folder mapped (see .command.run docker run command) and attaches visual studio if possible

Added settings.json for args/options

Fixed: when running too quickly after modifying settings, args/options may be undefined - need to synchronize

Instead of Run/Resume, just have Run, resume is set in settings.json

Don't do the run/archive folder thing, just do run_1... run_N and leave alone to allow for resume of any prior run

Add "Configure from nextflow run command-line..." parses a nextflow command-line and builds a pipeline from that

Update "Configure from nextflow run command-line..." to handle arbitrary project repo/script placement

FIXED Remaking pipeline (deleting then making w/ same name) breaks output window
